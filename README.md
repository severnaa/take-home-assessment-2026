# Installation

Note: We are using the next dev script and the next start script as the next build functionality can't verify the api when it is coming from localhost. I looked up some workarounds/configurations but I didn't feel that it was worth fixing when the dev script works just fine for the job at hand.

1. pull down the repo.
2. `npm install --no-save`
3. `npm run db:create-db`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## Run Tests with

- `npm run test`
